          <em>The Chronicles of Ka&apos;Maetheus</em> is a universe of many worlds and timelines. Some stories are already
          taking shape; others are still shadows at the edge of the map. Below is an overview of the series you&apos;ll
          eventually be able to travel through&mdash;starting with <strong>The Hunter Society</strong> on Pasi.

              On the world of Pasi, Hunters stand between ordinary people and the horrors that crawl out of a ruined past.
              <strong>The Hunter Society</strong> follows the apprentices, veterans, and traitors bound to an order that
              has been fighting too long, for too little thanks, against an enemy that never truly dies.

            <p class="book-blurb">
              Book 1, <em>Wings of Dawn: Hunter&apos;s Apprentice</em>, begins the saga as a fledgling hunter is pulled
              into a conflict far older and stranger than any monster in the training manuals.

              <strong>Chronicles of the Fallen</strong> peers into the aftermath of gods and heroes who failed. In these tales,
              the &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; aren&apos;t just angels or warriors&mdash;they are empires, orders, and people who once
              held the line and lost. The series explores what rises in the ruins: cults, new powers, and ordinary souls
              trying to survive the legacy of other people&apos;s catastrophes.

              The legends say the Ancient Ones vanished, or were bound, or were slain in ages no one remembers clearly.
              <strong>Return of the Ancient Ones</strong> asks a simpler question: what if they were only waiting? This
              series follows scattered characters as old powers begin to stir again&mdash;in the deep sky, below the earth,
              and in the parts of the soul no one should touch.

              In <strong>Code of Killers</strong>, the story narrows to blades, contracts, and the unspoken rules that
              keep professional killers from tearing the world apart faster than the monsters do. Set in the cracks between
              larger wars, this series follows assassins, spies, and hunters-for-hire whose loyalties are for sale&mdash;but
              whose personal codes might be the last thing holding back true chaos.

            As these series move from outline to draft to finished books, this page will gain reading orders, bonus material,
            and links to where you can get your hands on them. For now, consider this your map of the territories waiting
            beyond Pasi.
