        <p class="section-body">
          <em>The Chronicles of Ka&apos;Maetheus</em> span many worlds&mdash;shattered realms, forgotten spheres, and places
          that should have stayed myth. <strong>Pasi</strong> is where you enter: a bruised planet caught between fading gods,
          hungry empires, and the quiet, stubborn lives that refuse to be erased.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="section-body">
          Think of this page as your first gate. From here, you&apos;ll travel through Pasi&apos;s cities and wastelands,
          learn the rules of its magic, and hear the stories children whisper when the lamps go out. Other worlds in
          Ka&apos;Maetheus wait beyond the fog&mdash;but we begin here.

            <p>
              Pasi is a world built on fault lines&mdash;between old faiths and new powers, between the civilized glow of
              walled cities and the wild dark that presses in from the borders.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Borderland towns that cling to trade routes like lifelines.</li>
              <li>Ruined sites where something ancient clearly lost.</li>
              <li>Orders and societies trying to contain what slips through the cracks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The further you travel from the safe roads, the more the seams of reality show. Monsters aren&apos;t always
              obvious. Neither are heroes.

            <h3>Magic System Section</h3>
            <p>
              On Pasi, power is never free. Magic moves through <em>pacts</em>, <em>marks</em>, and the old echoes of Ka&apos;Maetheus
              itself. Every working has a cost&mdash;in memory, in blood, in the slow erosion of who you think you are.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some orders bind themselves to ancient beings for borrowed strength.</li>
              <li>Some carve sigils into steel, bone, or their own skin.</li>
              <li>Some pretend there is no magic at all&mdash;until it comes collecting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Hunters who walk this world don&apos;t just fight monsters. They wrestle with the price of the power they use
              to face them.
            </p>

          <!-- Fairy Tales & Mythologies Section -->
          <article class="world-card">
            <h3>Fairy Tales &amp; Mythologies Section</h3>
            <p>
              The stories told to Pasi&apos;s children are not soft. Their lullabies remember cities that vanished overnight,
              rivers that ran backwards for a year, and saints who broke the sky to keep something worse from getting in.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Whispered tales of doors that appear only on storm nights.</li>
              <li>Fables about bargains you must never strike&mdash;and what happens if you do.</li>
              <li>Local myths that hint at the larger machinery of Ka&apos;Maetheus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As you read, you&apos;ll see these tales surface in tavern gossip, Hunter training, and the quiet fears of ordinary
              people. Pasi&apos;s myths are the breadcrumb trail to the deeper horrors, and wonders, of the wider universe.
